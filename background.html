Early life
Selena Marie Gomez was born on July 22, 1992, in Grand Prairie, Texas,[6] to Ricardo Joel Gomez[7] and Texas-born[7] former stage actress Mandy Teefey.[8] She was named after Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla, who died in 1995.[9][10] Her father is of Mexican descent, while her mother, who was adopted, has some Italian ancestry.[11][12][13] Gomez's paternal grandparents emigrated to Texas from Monterrey in the 1970s.[14] Of her heritage, Gomez has said she is "a proud third-generation American-Mexican"[15] and "My family does have quinceañeras, and we go to the communion church. We do everything that's Catholic, but we don't really have anything traditional except go to the park and have barbecues on Sundays after church."[16] Gomez was fluent in Spanish until age seven.[14] Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she remained with her mother.[8][17] Gomez has two younger half-sisters and a younger stepbrother: Gracie Elliot Teefey, through Amanda and her second husband, Brian Teefey,[18][19] and Victoria "Tori" and Marcus Gomez, through Ricardo and his second wife, Sara.[20] She earned her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2010.[21]

Gomez was born when her mother was 16 years old.[22] The family had financial troubles throughout Gomez's childhood, her mother struggling to provide for the pair. At one point, Gomez recalls that they had to search for quarters just to get gas for their car. Her mother later recalled that the two would frequently walk to their local dollar store to buy spaghetti for dinner.[23] Gomez has said, "I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas]."[24] She later added that her mother "was really strong around me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me." Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child and appeared in various pageants. Her grandparents often took care of her while her parents finished their schooling, and she has said they "raised her" until she found success in show business.[25]

I'm just looking to send a good message."[86][89] Gomez teamed up with designers Tony Melillo and Sandra Campos for the project, both of whom had previously worked with big-name fashion houses.[87] Melillo and Campos teamed with New York-based Adjmi Apparel to manufacture the brand, which was formed by Adjmi CH Brands LLC, the holding company for the brand.[90]

Gomez addressed the controversy, saying that "We stayed very true to the book and that's initially what [author] Jay Asher created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's what we wanted to do. We wanted to do it justice and, yeah, [the backlash is] gonna come no matter what. It's not an easy subject to talk about, but I'm very fortunate with how it's doing.[196] Aside from the project, Gomez has been working on new music with producers the Futuristics, Jonas Jeberg,[197] and Ryan Tedder[19</p>
